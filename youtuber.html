    <h3>Do I even want to be a YouTuber?</h3>

  <p class="essay-p">Right now, I really don't know.
    If you ask me every other day, the answer might change.<br></br>
    Growing up, it's the second thing I ever wanted to be. First was an arcitect.<br></br>

    I was born in 2001 and started watching YouTube around 2007. My best friend <a href="#">Tyler Loughery</a> 
    put me onto it. He also showed me the depths of the internet.<br></br>
    A few years later, and he was posting his own videos on there. I forget if he had the Droid smartphone first or a camcorder but we made videos with whatever we could.<br></br>

    Every time I went over to his house, I wanted to make a video. We did skit type videos together.<br></br>
    Influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/smosh">Smosh</a>. They showed us what was possible on YouTube beyond home videos.
    I don't think I ever had the thought, "Are they making money off this?"<br></br>
    Maybe I assumed so since they were so popular but all I know is I wanted to make videos.<br></br>
    It was fun for Tyler and I. He did all of the editing too.<br></br>
    I just wanted to make videos with my best friend. Like Ian & Anthony were doing with Smosh.<br></br>
    <img class="smosh-gif" src="https://media.tenor.com/pjO6eGwDx4cAAAAd/smosh-cop.gif"/>
    It wasn't always fun. There were times we didn't want to make videos.
    There were times that Tyler specifically didn't want to.<br></br>
    It was probably because of how much work he had to do on the editing side. Maybe it was the social pressure that comes from posting yourself online.<br></br>
    Fast foward to today, and Tyler has overcome that social pressure in his own way. He is part of a band called <a>ABBATIA</a> with two other childhood friends of ours.<br></br>
    Tyler does all of the band's video editing for music videos and social media. I've helped them film a few music videos and I record their shows sometimes.<br></br>
    Lady Casey does ABBATIA's photography and video sometimes as well.<br></br>
    Tyler may not be a YouTuber today, but he performs music in front of live crowds.
    He's able to express himself on stage. I can't speak for him entirely but it seems those social pressures don't exist in the way they did before.<br></br>
    He seems free on stage. A true artist in a state of flow.<br></br>
    YouTube was just a part of the journey for him. From an early age, it taught him how to
    express himself through a medium of art and gave him the editing experience
    he still uses today.<br></br>
    He does everything from writing music, performing, filming, editing, 3D modeling, SFX, and more. And he's really good at it.<br></br>
    So what's my journey?<br></br>
    Is my "need" to be a YouTuber genuine or was that time just a start of a different path, just as it was for Tyler.<br></br>
    I really don't know, but I'm figuring it out. I have a passion
    for making photos and videos but I can't decide whether I belong in
    front of the camera, or in front of it.
