  <h3>Do I even want to be a YouTuber?</h3>

  <p class="essay-p">Right now, I really don't know.
    If you ask me every other day, the answer might change.<br></br>
    Growing up, it's the second thing I ever wanted to be. First was an arcitect.<br></br>

    I was born in 2001 and started watching YouTube around 2007. My best friend <a href="#">Tyler Loughery</a> 
    put me onto it. He also showed me the depths of the internet.<br></br>
    A few years later, and he was posting his own videos on there. I forget if he had the Droid smartphone first or a camcorder but we made videos with whatever we could.<br></br>

    Every time I went over to his house, I wanted to make a video. We did skit type videos together.<br></br>
    Influenced by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/smosh">Smosh</a>. They showed us what was possible on YouTube beyond home videos.
    I don't think I ever had the thought, "Are they making money off this?"<br></br>
    Maybe I assumed so since they were so popular but all I know is I wanted to make videos.<br></br>
    It was fun for Tyler and I. He did all of the editing too.<br></br>
    I just wanted to make videos with my best friend. Like Ian & Anthony were doing with Smosh.<br></br>
    <img src="https://media.tenor.com/pjO6eGwDx4cAAAAd/smosh-cop.gif"/>
    It wasn't always fun. There were times we didn't want to make videos.
    There were times that Tyler specifically didn't want to.<br></br>
    It was probably because of how much work he had to do on the editing side. Maybe it was the social pressure that comes from posting yourself online.<br></br>
    Fast foward to today, and Tyler has overcome that social pressure in his own way. He is part of a band called <a>ABBATIA</a> with two other childhood friends of ours.
